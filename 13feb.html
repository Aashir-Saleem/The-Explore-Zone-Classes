                This example uses two documents: the HTML file (example.html)
        and a separate CSS file (example.css). The fifth line of HTML uses the
        element to indicate where the CSS file is located.
        On the next page, you will see how CSS rules can also be placed in your
        HTML pages and we will discuss when you might want to do this.
